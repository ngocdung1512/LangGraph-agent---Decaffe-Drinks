# LangGraph-agent---Decaffe-Drinks
Building an agent with LangGraph and the Gemini API

In this notebook, you will use LangGraph to define a stateful graph-based application built on top of the Gemini API.

You will build a simulated cafe ordering system, called BaristaBot. It will provide a looping chat interface to customers where they can order cafe beverages using natural language, and you will build nodes to represent the cafe's live menu and the "back room" ordering system.

BaristaBot is used in other Gemini API demos, so if you are looking to explore something with a more minimal implementation, check out the BaristaBot function calling example that implements a similar system using only the Gemini API Python SDK and function calling.

IMPORTANT!
The app built in this notebook takes user input using a text box (Python's input). These are commented-out to ensure that you can use the Run all feature without interruption. Keep an eye out for the steps where you need to uncomment the .invoke(...) calls in order to interact with the app.
